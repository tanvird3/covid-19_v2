# COVID-19 Data Visualizer
This simple Shinyapp (the raw code file is also here) extracts data from John Hopkins University's github repository (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) and generates interactive plots regarding COVID-19 pandemic. The base country is set as Bangladesh, other countries can be selected for comparative analysis.

#### If you want to run the app natively from your own machine, run the run_from_github.R from RStudio.
